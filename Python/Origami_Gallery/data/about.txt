Hello!
Origami is often the way I use to distract myself, especially when I have to face a stressful situation, like the exams in the college. Folding orimamis helps me to relax, increase my concentration and extract my creativity while exploring new materials.
Several of the compositions was created using simple materials, like differents kind of cable, cork and bottles. Sometimes I explore less common materials, such as bamboo trunk that had been pruned from my garden.
Then I create this page to expose my origamis while I train programming.
